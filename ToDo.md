# ToDo

Organise start up functions

-  Check for new audiobooks, then conditionally scan for new tracks
-  Then just get the tracks data from the database

## Thinking...

-  On startup
   -  Scan the drive for books
   -  Find corresponding database records for existing books
   -  Create new records for new books
   -  For each book:
   -  Get the total book percentage
   -  Get the current position data
